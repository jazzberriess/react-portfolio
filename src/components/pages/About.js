      <p>
        I'm an enthusiastic full-stack junior to the world of web development.
        For front-end development, I have skills in
        <span class="bold">HTML5, CSS</span> and
        <span class="bold"> JavaScript</span>. I've also used libraries such as{' '}
        <span class="bold">jQuery</span> and CSS frameworks like
        <span class="bold">Bootstrap</span> and
        <span class="bold">Skeleton</span>. For back-end development, I have
        experience in <span class="bold">node.js, express,</span> a variety of
        <span class="bold">npm's, SQL, MySQL databases</span> and the
        <span class="bold">Sequelize ORM</span>. I've also used
        <span class="bold">Insomnia</span> for API testing and the
        <span class="bold">Heroku</span> platform to deploy completed projects
        on. Outside of web-specific skills, I have extensive experience in the
        customer service space, so my
        <span class="bold">interpersonal skills</span> and ability to
        <span class="bold">work as part of a successful team</span> are
        impeccible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently expanding my skillset to include
        <span class="bold">React</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have two feline co-workers who sometimes like to help me with
        projects. They're both aspiring Koding Kitties, who seemingly want to
        specialise in keyboard accessibility.
