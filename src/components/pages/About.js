        <p>
          I'm an enthusiastic full-stack junior to the world of web development.
          For front-end development, I have skills in
          <span className="bold"> HTML5, CSS</span> and
          <span className="bold"> JavaScript</span>. I've also used libraries
          such as <span className="bold"> jQuery</span> and CSS frameworks like
          <span className="bold"> Bootstrap</span> and
          <span className="bold"> Skeleton</span>. For back-end development, I
          have experience in <span className="bold">node.js, express,</span> a
          variety of
          <span className="bold"> npm's, SQL, NoSQL databases</span> and the
          <span className="bold">Sequelize and Mongoose ORMs</span>. I've also
          used
          <span className="bold"> Insomnia</span> for API testing and the
          <span className="bold"> Heroku</span> platform to deploy completed
          projects on. Outside of web-specific skills, I have extensive
          experience in the customer service space, so my
          <span className="bold"> interpersonal skills</span> and ability to
          <span className="bold"> work as part of a successful team</span> are
          impeccible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently expanding my skillset to include
          <span className="bold">React</span>.
